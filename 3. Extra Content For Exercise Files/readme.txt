In this folder are various supplementary files & code snippets for some of the exercises. I organized them into folders. Not ever exercise section required some.
The javonet.xml applies to several exercises so I left it in the root of this folder. You don’t HAVE to use it if you’re activating javonet in C#. Using the XML file for activation is just one option.

If you enjoy the course, please leave feedback on lynda.com at end of course.

Enjoy!
